# DSC180A_A2 "Result Replication Template"

This repository contains the template in which a data science result replication project will be in.

You can sample our 2 Layer GCN by running the run.py file. The run.py file uses both the cora.cites and cora.contents datasets from the data directory. Through data ingestion
we modified the two datasets to become an adjecency matrix and feature matrix, which are used as the input to our GCN model.
